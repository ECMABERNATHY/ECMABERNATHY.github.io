I started this journey by accident, several years ago. I do a lot of my thinking and life scheming in the shower... I decided that working in the wine industry after almost a decade no longer served me purpose. So, each night after I made my two hour commute home, I would eat, and shower and plan how I was 1) going to break into tech and 2) work for a tech company in San Francisco. 

Here is why... San Francisco is by far my most favorite city in the world. Yes, I said it. While I do love New York, LA and other metros around the world, there is something so special about San Francisco... and maybe I just happen to have a little bit of that California born and bred bias. 

Through the two years of mindfull intention practice, I finally landed myself in San Francisco, in a real estate tech company. Not quite there, but on the way. During that time, I realized that my true inner self, was actually an introverted self-proclaimed nerd, who just wanted to stay home in a quiet room and learn to code.... who knew? 

The current role wasnt fulfilling that need, so I started dabbling in online coding programs to see what was of interest to me. As luck would have it, a recruiter reached out to me unexpectedly with an offer that I was very skeptical about from the beginning. Cryptocurrency???? Huh???? Hmmmm.... ya, I dont think so... I think I will just stay in this other job that isnt fullfilling... thank you very much! 

Wait a second, I thought to myself one night in the shower while washing my hair. Why not? What am I afraid of? This is an amazing opportunity and I am sure that I could be on the right track to eventually becoming an engineer... ( which is what I would later confirm as my dream role) 

Fast forward 1 1/2 years later... and here I am. Working for Coinbase, a crypto enthusiast and on my way to becoming an engineer at my company (hopefully!) 

This is a snapshot of my journey.... I look forward to documenting it here.
